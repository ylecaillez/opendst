/**
 * Runtime view of a deployment, baked into the self-contained JAR by the build plugin
 * and read by the child JVM at startup (and by the parent runner to assemble the
 * child JVM command line).
 *
 * <p>This is the post-enrichment, runtime-only counterpart to {@code DeploymentDescriptor}
 * (in {@code opendst-maven-plugin}). Where the descriptor carries build-time concerns
 * (sealed {@code Source} hierarchy with {@code artifact}/{@code dir}/{@code scope}
 * variants, Maven project metadata, custom Jackson factories), {@code RuntimeDeployment}
 * contains only what the runner and launcher need at startup: the JVM argument string
 * assembled by the build plugin and per-service {@code dir}/{@code className}/{@code ip}/
 * {@code args} tuples plus an optional trace auditor.
 *
 * <p>The wire format is plain JSON (no annotations, no polymorphism) so it can be parsed
 * by {@code jackson-jr} on the child side without dragging {@code jackson-databind} or
 * {@code jackson-yaml} into the agent JAR.
 *
 * <p>The build plugin produces this from an enriched {@code DeploymentDescriptor} where
 * every service's source has been resolved to a {@code Source.Dir} pointing at an
 * {@code apps/} subdirectory.
